🔗 Live Demo: https://forkifymanish.vercel.app/

I’m excited to share one of my favorite projects — Forkify, a recipe search and bookmarking web app built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This project focuses on functionality, real-time API integration, and a clean, responsive design.

✨ Key Features:

✅ Search Recipes by ingredients, meal type, or cuisine – all in real-time using a third party API<br/>
✅ Bookmark Favorites to keep track of the recipes you love<br/>
✅ Detailed Recipe View – ingredients, cooking steps, and nutrition info<br/>
✅ Responsive UI – works smoothly on both desktop and mobile<br/>
✅ Serving Adjustment – scale ingredients based on your needs<br/>
